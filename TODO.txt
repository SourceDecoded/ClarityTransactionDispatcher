1. Add updated_date and created_date to entity and component. This will allow systems to sort the entities by created or updated date.
2. Require entities and components to have a type (string) property.
3. Entity Typing can be achieved by a component.
    a. The component would reference another entity that declared is properties in the form of JSON.
    b. It may also reference another entity that had its validator on it
4. Component Typing can be achieved by a component.
5. DONE Add Logging hook for systems.
    a. warn
    b. error
    c. log
6. Add a way for systems to log through the dispatcher.
7. validateEntityRemovalAsync()
8. validateComponentRemovalAsync()
9. We need to not restart the dispatcher on errors caused by uncaught futures. This is just silly... The standard disappointed me.
